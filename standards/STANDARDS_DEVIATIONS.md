# Standards Deviations Log

**Purpose**: Track deviations from project coding standards (JSF AV C++, DEBUG_OUTPUT.md, CODING_STANDARDS.md) with severity, remediation difficulty, and rationale.

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-02 (Fresh start - post branch reorganization)

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Must fix before flight code; safety or reliability impact |
| **High** | Should fix before production; may cause subtle issues |
| **Medium** | Fix when touching affected code; technical debt |
| **Low** | Acceptable for test/debug code; cosmetic or stylistic |
| **Accepted** | Intentional deviation with documented rationale |

## Difficulty Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Trivial** | Simple search-and-replace or single-line change |
| **Easy** | Localized changes, no API impact |
| **Moderate** | Multiple files or requires testing |
| **Hard** | Architectural changes or external dependencies |

## Active Deviations

*No active deviations - starting fresh with bespoke implementation.*

---

## Resolved

*Previous deviations archived with `AP_FreeRTOS` branch.*

---

## Review Schedule

- **Before Flight Code**: Review all Low severity items in production paths
- **Quarterly**: Audit new code for standards compliance

---

## Notes

1. Test code (`tests/`) has relaxed standards enforcement to enable rapid validation
2. Production code (`src/`) must strictly follow all standards
3. New deviations should be logged here before merging to main
