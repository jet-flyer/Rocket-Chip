# Agent Whiteboard

**Purpose:** Communication across context windows and between agents.

**Stages 1-13 COMPLETE.** 598+ host tests, SPIN 6/6. Stage 3D (3-axis mag) complete. Stage 7 Take 2 complete. All post-Stage 13 side items resolved (2026-04-06). Tracking: `docs/AO_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Use Cases
1. **Cross-agent review** - Flag concerns about other agents' work (see `CROSS_AGENT_REVIEW.md`)
2. **Cross-context handoff** - Notes for future Claude sessions when context is lost
3. **Work-in-progress tracking** - Track incomplete tasks spanning multiple sessions
4. **Hardware decisions pending** - Flag items needing user input before code changes
5. **This is a whiteboard** - Erase completed items. Only keep active flags and deferred work.

## Open Flags

*None currently. Beginning Stage 13 (Pre-Flight Polish).*

### Protected File Updates Pending Approval

*None currently.*

## Upcoming Stages

**Stage 13: Health Monitor** — Dedicated stage. Building centralized health monitoring from scratch (not patching fragments). Council-reviewed plan in `.claude/plans/rosy-dazzling-charm.md`.

**Stage 14: Pre-Flight Polish** (14A Telemetry Polish, 14B System Polish, 14C Verification)

**Stage 15: Field Tuning** — All VALIDATE parameters. Needs flight data.

See plan file for full breakdown.

### Deferred (near-term, post-Stage 14)

- **Battery ADC Monitoring** — Hardware not wired. ADC pin + driver + telemetry field.
- **CCSDS SDLS Command Authentication** — Telecommand auth for Rocket profile.
- **Notification Engine** — Evaluate during Stage 13; AP_Notify-style intent layer above LED Engine.
- **IVP-103 Station GPS Push** — Needs radio command path.

### Far-future (moved to PROJECT_STATUS)

Mission Profile OTA, F' Evaluation, u-blox GPS, OTA drivers, GPS-free 3D reconstruction, FSK bitstream, MATLAB export — all moved to `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` future features.
