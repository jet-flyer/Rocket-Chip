# RocketChip Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-09 by Claude

## Current Phase
Phase 0 (scaffolding) - starting fresh after scope reset.

## Active Work
- [ ] Validate PlatformIO + RP2350 + FreeRTOS toolchain
- [ ] Hardware verification tests (sensors functional on dev board)
- [ ] Finalize platformio.ini configurations
- [ ] GETTING_STARTED.md for fresh-clone verification
- [ ] Directory structure scaffolding

## Blocked On
Nothing currently.

## Next Milestone
Phase 0 complete: Project compiles, uploads, runs FreeRTOS blink task. CI passes. Hardware verified.

## Back Burner
- Middle tier product name decision
- Pro tier name decision (Nova vs Titan)
- Ground station software evaluation
- Telemetry protocol final selection (CRSF/CCSDS vs raw MAVLink)

## Side Projects
- Pegasus flight controller (full FC for drones, glide-back boosters - informed by madflight FC3)
- Fruit Jam as potential ground station platform
- OpenMCT integration exploration

## Known Issues
- Legacy Arduino codebase archived in DEPRECATED/ (not carried forward)
