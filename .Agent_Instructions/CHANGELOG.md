# Changelog

## Format
`### YYYY-MM-DD-NNN | Author | tags`

Optional rationale in italics below. Files affected in parentheses if relevant.

**Frequency:** Typically one entry per session, not per individual change. Log when a task is completed or work transitions to a new focus. However, if multiple *significant* changes occur in one session (e.g., refactoring logging system AND redesigning state engine), create separate entries for each.

**Tags:** bugfix, feature, architecture, tooling, hardware, council, documentation, refactor
