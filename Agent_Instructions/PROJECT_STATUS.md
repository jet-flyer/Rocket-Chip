# RocketChip Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29 by Claude

## Current Phase
Documentation and architecture planning. Preparing for clean sheet codebase refactor.

## Active Work
- [ ] Agent instruction file set
- [ ] Consolidate hardware documentation
- [ ] Design ArduPilot library integration approach for new codebase

## Recently Completed
- [x] Council review process defined
- [x] RP2350 confirmed as primary platform (council reviewed)
- [x] Decision to abandon Arduino IDE (ToS concerns)
- [x] Cross-agent review protocol established

## Blocked On
Nothing currently.

## Next Milestone
Complete agent instruction set. Begin clean sheet codebase with ArduPilot module integration from day one.

## Back Burner
- Middle tier product name decision
- Pro tier name decision (Nova vs Titan)
- Ground station software evaluation

## Side Projects
- Pegasus flight controller (full FC product for drones, glide-back boosters, etc. - informed by madflight FC3)
- Fruit Jam as potential ground station platform
- OpenMCT integration exploration

## Known Issues
- Legacy Arduino codebase exists in repo but will not be carried forward to new architecture
