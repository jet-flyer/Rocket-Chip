# RocketChip Agent Instructions

## Read First
Read these fully on first session. Re-read only if changelog notes updates.

- **docs/SAD.md** - Software Architecture Document (system design, modules, interfaces, task model)
- **docs/SCAFFOLDING.md** - Directory structure and implementation status
- **STANDARDS.md** - Coding standards, communication protocols, data formats, safety requirements
- **HARDWARE.md** - Prototype hardware, GPIO usage, I2C conflicts, product naming
- **COUNCIL_PROCESS.md** - How to run panel reviews and persona behavior
- **CROSS_AGENT_REVIEW.md** - Protocol for flagging concerns in other agents' work

## Each Session
These change often. Check at the start of every session.

- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Current phase, blockers, planned work
- **CHANGELOG.md** - When, who, what, why
- **AGENT_WHITEBOARD.md** - Flags and quirks noticed in other agents' work

## Key Rules
- Adafruit components preferred unless notably better alternative exists
- Log all significant changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Never silently modify another agent's work
- Coding standards are mandatory—no deviations without explicit approval (see exceptions table in STANDARDS.md)
- Repository content takes priority over AI memory; flag discrepancies for review
