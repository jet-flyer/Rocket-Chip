# Agent Decisions & Reference Architecture

**Purpose:** Read-only documents produced by council reviews and architectural decisions. These represent decided design direction and should not be modified without explicit approval.

## Contents

Documents in this folder are outputs from structured decision processes (council reviews, architecture evaluations). They capture the reasoning and conclusions that guide implementation.

### How to Use

- **Agents:** Read these for design context and architectural constraints. Follow the decisions documented here. Do not modify these files.
- **Implementation:** Use the architectural patterns described here as your guide. If implementation reveals a conflict with a decision document, flag it for review — don't silently deviate.
- **Numerical parameters:** Some documents contain preliminary numerical values (marked as "pending review" or similar). Treat these as starting points requiring validation, not as final values.

### Adding Documents

New documents are added here when:
- A council review produces an architectural decision
- A design trade-off is evaluated and a direction is chosen
- A reference architecture is adopted from external sources

All additions require explicit user approval.
